"""Equity indexes, from Yahoo's keyless chart API.

(Stooq was a fallback until it put its CSV endpoint behind a JavaScript
proof-of-work wall; it returned HTTP 200 with an HTML challenge body rather
than an error, so it failed at parse time and never served a quote. Removed
2026-09-06 along with an optional IBKR path that returned data flagged just as
delayed as Yahoo's -- see "Why no brokerage integration?" in the README.)

Writes daily closes to series 'idx:{symbol}' and the latest quotes to the
'equity_quotes' doc: {symbol: {last, ts, source, delayed}}.
